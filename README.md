# hello-world
This is Luke's GitHub Genesis and this is where my Dev projects are. 

 I live in Patterson CA, I wrote and published my first book on Gnostic visions at age 30. I spent 4 years researching the topic indepth. The book is a cutting edge historical study. I am now applying my passion and motivated work ethic to becoming a software develeper. I really like to code and look forward to pouring my passion into this new skill and craft.
